## Features

* Search across all notes
* Hierarchical organization and display of notes
* Password based encryption
* Cloud sync
* Markdown based markup and syntax highlighting


### Updating SublimeNotebook or changing password

* To update your installation of Sublime Notebook, decrypt your existing notes using old manager.py, then force exit the script before encrypting. Then update the script files from this repo and start `manager.py` to re-encrypt your notes.
* Same method can be used if you want to change the password used to secure the notes.


### FAQ

* Only `*.txt`, `*.md` and `*.notes` files are detected as notes.
* You don't need to be in decrypted state to create a new note. Even when in encrypted state, you can create a note. When manager.py starts decrypting the notes, 
this new file will be ignored and will be encrypted when it's time to encrypt.
